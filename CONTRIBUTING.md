The "always-on-time" repository is a simple and installable web extension that changes the default home page when new tabs open.

We're really happy to accept contributions, either as ideas for new features or improvements. This file lists some general guidelines to help contributors.

## Types of contribution

There are many ways you can help improve this repository! For example:

* **suggest an idea for a new feature:** 
we'd love to hear about new funtionality that you might find useful.
* **identify an issue:** 
you can create a new issue in our [issues tab](https://github.com/ossd-s23/always-on-time/issues) if you notice a bug or other things that can be improved. 
* **fix a bug:** 
we have a list of [issues](https://github.com/mdn/webextensions-examples/issues).
or maybe you found your own.
* **add to the documentation:** 
you can edit the documentations if you find any of them inconsistent with the actual application.


## Code style

If you're editing an existing file, code style should be consistent with the rest of the code in the file. Otherwise, code style should follow the style for WebExtensions code itself: [https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions/Hacking#Code_Style](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions/Hacking#Code_Style).
